 Minute Murder Mystery:

 What I will be lovingly refering to as "M3" from this point forward was a one-week final project 
 for my second introductory game development course. In the heat of my other finals, I came up with the oh so silly idea
 of having a giant mystery to solve and not nearly enough time to solve it. This may have been influence by real life events(finals week).

 In the face of intense budget cuts and rising crime, the police department has decided that time is money, and you 
 need to spend less of it investigating. The player is expected to deduce who was responsible for the 
 murder of one "Naseem Deceased" with only one minute to interview suspects and 

 If development of "M3" ever continues, I'm sure some overarching story could be drawn from this silly little proof of concept. 
 Perhaps each one minute mystery leads into one larger mystery. A... ten minute mystery, if you will.


 Note: This specific piece requires Unity to be installed.
 Please navigate to "..\Assets\Scenes\TitleScreen.unity" to access the game. 
 When this assignment was initially due, we were not intended to greate full builds of the game for ease of grading.
 In the near future this will be fixed and a complete build will be accessible.
