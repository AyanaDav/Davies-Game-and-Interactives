INSTRUCTIONS


GOAL: Your goal is to put out all of the lava blocks on the floor. There are five sections in total. To move forward, you'll need to clear each section first.


LIVES: You have 3 lives (or 4? I don't know how to count). Point being, you can touch the lava up to three times without dying. So I guess that's technically 4 lives


LAVA: THE FLOOR IS LAVA! DON'T TOUCH IT! Touching the lava will remove a life and cause the player to auto jump. 


MOVEMENT:
Move horizontally with "A" and "D" or the left and right arrow keys. The gave uses the horizontal axis in case you want to format it for gamepad.


JUMP / WALL JUMP / CLIMB: 
Jump and wall jump with the spacebar. If you'd like to format it for gamepad, the project setting button is listed as "Jump".
Climb underneath surfaces by repeatedly pressing the jump button.


GRAB BUCKET:
Hold "Q" to grab the bucket. Once you've grabbed it, you can release the button and it will follow you. For gamepad, this is listed as "Fire1"


LET GO OF BUCKET:
Press "E" to let go of the bucket. On gamepad, this is listed as "Fire2".
