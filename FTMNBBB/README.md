# Davies Game and Interactives
 A collection of all of my interactive experiences, prototypes, and games. 

Father Time and Mother Nature Give Birth to a Bouncing Baby Boomer(FTMNBB):

"When two vague concepts love each other very much, they give birth 
to an entire generation of people who take them for granted"

It should be made clear that I did petition for the name to be shorter. My team threatened 
to quit if I changed the name. Thus, it has stuck (and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way).

FTMNBB is a problem-solving narrative cozy game by design. You play as “Boomer”, a young child to the 
wonderful parents of Father Time and Mother Nature. Father Time is a forward thinking man. He pushes 
forward, often forgetting the cost. Mother Nature is more subdued and present thinking, yet forgets nothing. 
Complete household chores and bonding activities alongside each of your parents. The more flowers you 
successfully plant and appliances you successfully fix, the closer you grow to them. Learn their 
views on life, each other, and of Boomer. However, to spend time with one is to disengage with the other, 
and not all is stable in Boomer’s household

For the entire 3 person team, this was our first venture into Unity and C# scripting. This meant that 
a significant portion of the first two weeks was spent rapidly learning a new coding language and also
how to adequately design an experience. As a first attempt in the middle of a busy year, I find myself 
looking back at this project with fondness. I sensed growth with each and every new script that got made, 
and by the end of the project already saw ways to improve our workflows from when we were all beginners 
in C# and the Unity environment.


To access the full build:
In this same folder, enter into "Visual Scripting Attempt". Part of the learning process, we quickly found out, 
was that having consistent naming across computers was important, especially for first timers and even more 
so for merging builds. When I revisit this game, that'll be the first thing I fix!
