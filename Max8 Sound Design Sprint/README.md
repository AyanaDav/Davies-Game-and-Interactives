 Sound Design Sprint: Application for live gaming

 The following is a Max8 project intended to assist with live gaming ambience and music. When running a tabletop game, game runners (GMs) have a lot to manage, and though a music component can heightened an experience, it can be a lot to manage on top of other concurrent responsibilities. The program is a proof of concept of an application that:
  - Randomly generates music of a customizable key. The user can set a key siganture and differentiate between major and natural minor keys.
  - self-moderates its volume based on environmental input. The microphone listens for the volume level of the surrounding area. The louder the room, the quieter the music so as to not wash out sound. The quieter the room, the louder the music gets. 

 The instrument in the was project was hand created with the base of a sawtooth wave. At this point, the music does sound very Stardew Valley adjacent, which was the goal for the proof of concept, but definitely isn't the average tabletop experience. In future, I would love to experiment more with the music generation and create different instrument, However, I developed this for a class while on a free trial, and the cost for the Max8 program is currently out of my personal budget. The project is on hiatus until I can purchase the program.
